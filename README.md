# personalized_health_insurance_premium_predictor
In this project I will develop and deploy a machine learning-based predictive model for Shield Insurance to accurately estimate health insurance premiums based on demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors. The solution will include a cloud-deployed model with an interactive web application for insurance underwriters.
